Pandas for data cleaning

Data Cleaning:

I carefully explored and cleaned the dataset to ensure the data was usable for analysis and visualization:
Removed Null Values: Missing or incomplete data was handled by identifying and dropping rows with missing values, as well as addressing duplicate rows.
Data Transformation: Data was transformed where necessary, such as converting state abbreviations to state names, changing the dtype of dates, correcting the structured format of date and time (%d, %m, %Y), and addressing inconsistencies in the dataset.
