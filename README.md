Pandas for data cleaning

Data Cleaning:

I carefully explored and cleaned the dataset to ensure the data was usable for analysis and visualization:
Removed Null Values: Missing or incomplete data was handled by identifying and dropping rows with missing values, as well as addressing duplicate rows.
Data Transformation: Data was transformed where necessary, such as converting state abbreviations to state names, changing the dtype of dates, correcting the structured format of date and time (%d, %m, %Y), and addressing inconsistencies in the dataset.

Power BI Dashboard:

The BI Dashboard provides an interactive and comprehensive analysis of vehicle inventory, sales, and key metrics.
Average Metrics: Shows average price, odometer reading values, and condition score.
Price and Odometer Analysis:
   Price and Odometer Distribution:  Histogram visualizing the frequency of odometer mileage and the distribution of vehicle prices.

Vehicles by Condition: card showing the condition score of vehicles.
Top Sellers: Identifies the most active sellers in the dataset.
